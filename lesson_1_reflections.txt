How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It's much easier to find what's wrong

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    By the amount of changes made we can loose important information, things
    which we thought was gonna be useless, but we find out a new necessity to
    use it.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Less data to analyze at the time of trying to fix something.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    To keep a full version of the repository. I mean, I would like to get the
    complete version of my project at that commit, maybe the last version that
    was running.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    It's just to "log" to read the commits list and then you check the
    difference between the commits you would like to compare.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It because everything is saved. I don't mind commit a mistake if i can
    find the version in which it is not, and I can compare the files to fix
    it

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    My homework and projects!
